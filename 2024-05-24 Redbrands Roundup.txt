### Engaging with the Townmaster (39:20 - 43:36)

### Negotiations and Group Dynamics (43:37 - 45:29)

The group discusses the logistics of the reward and whether it is divided among them or offered individually.

### Negotiating with the Townmaster (45:30 - 46:12)

Harbin dismisses the ruffians as mere thugs who hang out at the Sleeping Giant tavern and claims they are not a significant threat.

### Persuasion and Detect Good and Evil (46:13 - 47:54)

The group decides to persuade Harbin to offer a higher reward. One member suggests using a perception skill to persuade Harbin, while another casts "Detect Good and Evil" to sense any malevolent presence.

### Increased Reward and Insight Check (47:55 - 50:02)

Ryan proposes an additional 100 gold pieces for dealing with the Red Brands, and Harbin reluctantly agrees. Meanwhile, another member performs an insight check to discern if Harbin is hiding anything. The check reveals that Harbin is merely a power-hungry individual who genuinely believes the Red Brands are not a significant threat. The group feels assured but continues their negotiation for better compensation.

### Finalizing the Deal and Planning (50:03 - 55:36)

Harbin agrees to a total of 200 gold pieces for clearing out the Red Brands and another 100 gold pieces for rescuing Gundren, making it 300 gold pieces in total. The group prepares to confront the ruffians, deciding to head to the Sleeping Giant tavern where the thugs are known to gather.

### Searching for Weapons (55:37 - 58:54)

One of the characters, seeking better equipment, decides to visit the Lion Shield Coster, a shop on the west side of town known for selling weapons and armor. Upon arrival, they are greeted by a shopkeeper who inquires if they are accompanied by their parents. The character clarifies they are looking for wrist blades, but the shopkeeper explains that such weapons are not typically in demand in Phandalin, which primarily serves miners and their needs.

### Weapon Search and Ghost's Recon Mission (58:56 - 1:00:00)

After discovering that the local weapon shop doesn't have the specific wrist blades they seek, the group regroups and discusses their next steps.

### Addressing the Followers and Preparing for Action (1:02:20 - 1:04:11)
