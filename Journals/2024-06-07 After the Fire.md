#### The Debate Over Lawfulness and Actions (23:53 - 27:29)

Returning to the group, the spider reports the findings: goblins armed with bows, multiple rooms, and potential for more enemies. The group discusses their options, debating whether to split up or stay together. The idea of splitting up is weighed against the need for strength in numbers. Given the past success of splitting up, there's some hesitation, but ultimately, the group decides to stick together for this mission. They plan to enter through the main gate and take advantage of the element of surprise.

#### Entering the Outpost (50:27 - 55:44)
