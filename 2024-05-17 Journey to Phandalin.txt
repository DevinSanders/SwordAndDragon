Another goblin emerges from the bushes, holding a bow. It knows the general direction of Speaker 2’s attack but cannot see him. The goblin decides to shoot at Speaker 5, but the arrow bounces off his shield. A second archer appears and targets Ignatius, resulting in a critical hit. The group discusses the implications of dual wielding shields and the mechanics of critical hits, joking about the effectiveness of their defensive strategies. Speaker 2 acknowledges the role of the healer in keeping the group alive, emphasizing the importance of staying near the healer during combat.

**Challenging Combat Dynamics and Hobgoblin Attack (51:55 - 54:17)**
The group continues its battle against the goblins and a hobgoblin. Speaker 4 remarks on their ability to keep each other alive, reinforcing their strategy. The hobgoblin rolls a 19 for an attack on Speaker 5, dealing minimal damage due to the natural armor, hitting him in the arm.

**Chasing the Archers (1:21:12 - 1:22:00)**
Speaker 7 starts flying straight after the two goblin archers who are running away. They discuss the goblins' speed, comparing it to a halfling’s. The players clarify that the goblins' movements are unaffected by the difficult terrain since they were not in the vine area. 

**Casting Entangle Again (1:22:01 - 1:23:19)**
The players decide to cast Entangle again to slow down the goblins. Speaker 4 releases concentration on the previous vines and successfully casts the spell on the fleeing goblins.

The group humorously considers the logistics of this tactic.

**Humorous Attempt to Ride and Attack (1:27:03 - 1:29:11)**
Ace attempts to jump on Speaker 3’s back while firing his crossbow. This leads to a humorous and chaotic scene where Speaker 3 considers grappling Ace to stop him. They both roll strength checks to determine if Ace can successfully jump onto his back and fire the crossbow simultaneously. The tension rises as they prepare to roll.

**Strength Check and Contested Ride Attempt (1:29:31 - 1:30:05)**
Ace (Speaker 2) tries to jump onto Mike (Speaker 3), resulting in a contested strength check. Ace gets a 15, but Mike gets an 11. Despite winning the check, Mike is resistant to being used as a mount, leading to a humorous exchange about the propriety and practicality of such an attempt.

**Goblin Attack and Prone Status (1:30:05 - 1:31:07)**

They discuss the new abilities and options available at level two, with a specific mention of action moments and the ability to cast spells. The session ends with a mix of logistical planning and light-hearted banter, reflecting the group's camaraderie and enjoyment of the game.

**Clarification on Hiding Mechanics (1:39:32 - 1:41:23)**
The players discuss the mechanics of hiding in the game. Speaker 2 questions how hiding works after a previous scenario where they hid behind a corner but were still spotted by zombies. The Dungeon Master (Speaker 1) explains that for a character to remain hidden, there must be something obstructing the line of sight or darkness. Hiding in plain sight or in daylight without such obstructions does not prevent enemies from seeing the character.

**Discussion on Leveling Up and Character Abilities (1:41:23 - 1:42:15)**
The conversation shifts to the recent leveling up to level 2. The Dungeon Master explains that leveling up required 300 experience points and emphasizes that this rapid advancement is not typical.

This story highlights the balance between character creativity and game mechanics.

**Noticing Trail Marks and Planning Next Steps (1:42:15 - 1:43:54)**
Mike (Speaker 3) notices trail marks and footprints where the goblins dragged their loot. His character’s passive perception allows him to easily spot these details. The group decides to take a short rest, which lasts about an hour, to regain some abilities and spell slots. The short rest helps the characters prepare for the next part of their journey.

**Strategy and Rest Mechanics (1:43:54 - 1:46:37)**
During the short rest, the players discuss the benefits they gain from it, such as recovering a spell slot or a breath weapon.

The conversation includes a humorous exchange about the necessity of rest and the practicality of their healer's spells.

**Discussing Light Sources and Continuing the Journey (1:46:37 - 1:49:44)**
As the group prepares to continue their journey, they discuss different ways to create light since they might travel after dark. Options range from using breath weapons to ignite torches to casting spells like Prestidigitation or using cantrips like Firebolt. This leads to a discussion about their spells and abilities, ensuring they are well-prepared for the night.

**Strategizing and Spell Discussions (1:49:50 - 1:51:10)**
The session resumes with a discussion about various spells and abilities. Speaker 6 mentions the "Toll the Dead" spell, explaining its damage mechanics and wisdom saving throw requirement. There's some humorous back-and-forth about the effectiveness and aesthetics of the spell. The group then talks about different ways to create light using their abilities, but Speaker 1 reminds them that it is still midday and there is no immediate need for light.

**Decision Point: Which Trail to Follow? (1:51:10 - 1:54:02)**
The party debates whether to follow the trail towards Phandalin or the one where the goblins dragged something into the woods. They discuss their mission to deliver provisions to Phandalin and the fact that their employers, Gundren and Sildar, might be in danger. The Dungeon Master clarifies that the trail towards Phandalin is about a half-day's journey and they can reach it before nightfall. Ultimately, the group decides to follow the dragging trail to potentially rescue their employers.

**Planning and Splitting the Party (1:54:02 - 1:56:11)**
As they prepare to follow the dragging trail, the party considers splitting up. Some members suggest staying with the wagon while others scout ahead. The group debates the merits of stealth and strength, and who should go into the woods. Speaker 4 jokes about riding on another character's back, which is quickly dismissed. They ultimately decide on a plan to investigate the trail together while being cautious.

**Clarifying Health and Healing Mechanics (1:56:11 - 1:57:30)**
The conversation shifts to clarifying how leveling up affects their hit points. The Dungeon Master explains that leveling up increases their maximum HP but doesn't automatically heal them. The players discuss their current health statuses and consider using healing spells. There's a brief mix-up about how many hit points were gained and lost, but it gets resolved.

**Casual Conversation and Game Continuation (1:57:30 - 1:58:16)**
Towards the end of the session, the conversation becomes more casual, touching on topics like sports and current events. The players mention a recent rule change and a golfer who was in the news. This light-hearted banter provides a break before they dive back into the game.

**Discussion on Recent News and Prepared Spells (1:58:17 - 2:01:10)**
The group continues their casual conversation about recent news involving the Louisville PD and the PGA's response to an incident. They then shift back to the game, with Speaker 3 declaring readiness with their prepared spell list. There is a brief moment of humor about marshmallows and the time of day.

**Debate on Party Roles and Stealth (2:00:02 - 2:01:10)**
The party members discuss their roles and abilities, particularly focusing on stealth. Speaker 2 claims to be the best scout, while others debate this based on their passive perception scores. They ultimately decide to split the party: some members will follow the goblin trail, while others will escort the wagon to ensure their mission is completed.

**Entering the Woods and Finding a Cave (2:01:10 - 2:03:37)**
The party splits into two groups. The group following the goblin trail travels through the woods for about an hour before arriving at a clearing with a hillside and a cave entrance. A small stream flows out of the cave. They observe goblin footprints leading into the cave.

**Approaching the Cave and Encountering Animals (2:03:37 - 2:06:29)**
As they approach the cave, they hear snarling and growling. Inside, they spot animals, likely wolves or dogs, chained up near the entrance. The animals grow more agitated as the party comes closer. Speaker 4 uses the "Speak with Animals" spell to communicate, discovering that the animals are being trained by goblins and are aggressive towards intruders.

**Exploring the Cave and Considering Options (2:06:29 - 2:08:28)**
While Speaker 4 communicates with the animals, the rest of the party examines their surroundings. They find a crevice leading upwards with light shining down but no other clear exits. They realize they must either find a way to bypass the aggressive animals or continue following the stream deeper into the cave. The animals, although chained, pose a threat if the party gets too close.

**Calming the Wolves and Negotiating Their Assistance (2:08:29 - 2:12:17)**
Speaker 4 uses their animal handling skills to calm the wolves, who are initially aggressive and wary of the party's presence. After successfully rolling a 15 on the animal handling check, the wolves become more relaxed. The wolves, still agitated but willing to communicate, question the party's intentions. They explain they are following goblin footprints that might lead them to their friends, Gundren and Sildar. The wolves mention that some of their masters returned recently but cannot provide specific details about numbers. The party then persuades the wolves, offering them better treatment and freedom in exchange for their help in finding their friends.

**Gaining the Wolves' Trust (2:12:17 - 2:13:46)**
The party continues to persuade the wolves by promising them food and better living conditions. With a persuasion roll of 19, the wolves agree to help if the party frees them. Speaker 4, assisted by Speaker 3, breaks the chains binding the wolves with a successful strength check. The wolves now have collars with a length of chain still attached but are otherwise free.

**Planning the Next Steps with the Wolves (2:13:46 - 2:16:38)**
The party introduces themselves to the wolves, who ask what the party wants them to do next. Speaker 4 introduces themselves as Stormwind and inquires about the wolves' names and any distinguishing features. The wolves, now allies, are ready to assist the party as they continue their quest to find Gundren and Sildar. Meanwhile, the rest of the party, who split off earlier, continues their journey towards Phandalin, unaware of the new allies the others have gained.

**Encounter with the Wolves and Adoption (2:16:38 - 2:18:11)**
The party, having successfully calmed the wolves, decides to adopt them as companions. The wolves, who had no names, were given names by the party: Stormageddon, Bulwark, and Ghost. The wolves show interest in wearing armor and learning to fly, although they lack wings. The party discusses how to modify chain mail to fit the wolves, realizing they would need an armorer’s help for proper adjustments. The wolves are excited about the new prospects, indicating their willingness to follow and assist the party.

**Teaching Commands and Following the Goblin Trail (2:18:11 - 2:20:04)**
The party, through Speaker 4, asks the wolves about their knowledge of commands like follow, stop, attack, and come back. The wolves, having been trained by goblins, know basic commands and are eager to assist further. The party then asks the wolves to lead them to their former masters and any possible captives. The wolves inform the party that their masters are further up in the cave and offer to guide them.

**Further Exploration of the Cave (2:20:04 - 2:24:02)**
The party, now accompanied by the wolves, moves deeper into the cave. They hear snarling and growling as they advance, indicating more creatures ahead. The wolves express their willingness to assist, as long as they receive treats like steak. The party also humorously discusses the logistics of their situation, including their plans to get gas and the operating hours of local gas stations, adding a light-hearted touch to their adventure.

**Navigating the Cave and Making Plans (2:24:02 - 2:26:19)**
As they proceed, the party ensures they have enough light to navigate the cave, while the wolves rely on their dark vision. Speaker 1, the dungeon master, indicates that the wolves will guide the party through the cave towards the goblin masters. The party discusses their plans to continue exploring and ensures everyone is prepared for the challenges ahead.

**Entering the Cave and Discovering Goblins (2:26:19 - 2:26:34)**
The party, led by the wolves, continues deeper into the cave alongside the stream. The wolves stop and indicate that many of their former masters are ahead, along with their big master further into the cave. They encounter a bridge indicating an upper level to the cave and start ascending rough stone stairs. At the top, they find three goblins resting by pools of water feeding the stream. The goblins are startled by the sight of the wolves, who were supposed to be chained, and rise to confront the party.

**Initiating Combat (2:26:34 - 2:30:10)**
Realizing they have the element of surprise, the party decides to attack the goblins. The initiative is rolled, and the party, along with the wolves, prepare for battle. Stormwing, one of the wolves, acts first, followed by the goblins, the rest of the wolves, and the party members. The first action taken by the party is a powerful guiding bolt cast by Speaker 4, which explodes a goblin on impact.

**Wolves Join the Fray (2:30:10 - 2:35:44)**
As the goblins react, they question the wolves' loyalty, but the wolves remain on the party’s side. The goblins attempt to strike the wolves but miss. The wolves, empowered by pack tactics, retaliate. Bulwark, one of the wolves, lands a critical hit, causing significant damage and nearly decapitating a goblin. This display of power from the wolves boosts the party's morale as they continue their assault.

**Decisive Actions and Outcomes (2:35:44 - 2:37:45)**
Following Bulwark's attack, the remaining wolves, Stormageddon and Ghost, take their turns. Stormageddon successfully mauls another goblin, eliminating the threat. The party discusses tactics and checks the remaining goblins. With two goblins already down, the battle continues with confidence as the party coordinates their efforts to clear the remaining enemies.

**Continuing the Battle and Securing Loot (2:37:46 - 2:40:28)**
After successfully mauling another goblin, the wolves receive praise from the party. Speaker 3 provides strips of meat as a reward, ensuring the wolves remain loyal and well-fed. Speaker 1 mentions that the goblin chainmail could potentially be modified to fit the wolves, making them even more formidable. The party members joke about the wolves’ honor and loyalty, appreciating their new companions.

**Exploring Further into the Cave (2:40:28 - 2:43:39)**
The wolves lead the party further into the cave. They encounter a smoldering fire, providing dim light. The area is littered with provisions, chests, crates, clothes, tools, and kegs of ale from previous wagons, likely the ones Gundren and Sildar had asked the party to protect. Close to the fire are a few goblins and a bugbear, along with another wolf that starts growling to alert the goblins and bugbear of the party's presence.

**Communication with the New Wolf (2:43:39 - 2:44:35)**
The new wolf, loyal to the bugbear, questions the other wolves about their chains and their alliance with the intruders. The party’s wolves respond, explaining that the party are their new masters who provide better food and care. They even mention getting belly rubs and ear scratches, which convinces the new wolf of their loyalty.

**Confrontation with the Bugbear (2:44:35 - 2:49:11)**
The bugbear, recognized as the big master, prepares for combat. The new wolf, feeling betrayed, vows to fight alongside the bugbear against the party and their wolves. The initiative is rolled again, and the three party wolves get to go first. Bulwark leads the attack, quickly mauling the opposing wolf with a critical hit. The remaining party wolves join in, swiftly eliminating the threat. With the enemy wolf down, the party prepares to confront the bugbear and the remaining goblins.

**Combat Continues: Wolves and Bugbear (2:49:18 - 2:52:03)**
As the battle rages on, the third wolf attempts to attack a goblin but misses. The bugbear, seeing his pet defeated, snarls and commands the goblins to handle the intruders while he tries to escape through a crevice at the back of the room. He moves swiftly but doesn't attack, focusing on his retreat.

The goblins, now alert and ready to fight, take their turn. Both rolled a 17 for initiative, placing them high in the order. They decide to attack the wolves. The first goblin strikes a wolf with a scimitar, causing a deep gash and severe damage, but the wolf survives the hit. The second goblin follows up, attacking the same wolf, which succumbs to the wounds and falls unconscious.

**Ash’s Turn and Hex (2:53:59 - 2:55:00)**
Ash steps up next, casting Hex on the goblin that killed the wolf, placing a curse on it and dealing extra necrotic damage with each hit. He then attacks the cursed goblin, landing a hit and obliterating it. Ash then targets the remaining goblin but misses his second attack.

**Strategic Moves and Bugbear’s Entanglement (2:55:00 - 2:56:23)**
The remaining wolves are given commands to either heal their fallen comrade or pursue the bugbear. Speaker 4 decides to use Entangle to prevent the bugbear from escaping. The bugbear, halfway through the crevice, gets entangled and stuck, unable to move further.

**Distraught Wolves and Ongoing Combat (2:56:23 - 3:00:01)**
The wolves, visibly upset about their fallen comrade, struggle to focus and fail to land effective attacks on the remaining goblins. The bugbear, trapped in the crevice, attempts to break free but remains stuck due to the entanglement and his large size. The remaining goblin attacks Ash but misses, leaving him unharmed.

**The Battle Rages On (3:00:01 - 3:01:13)**
The fight continues as Ash takes his turn, moving the Hex to the remaining goblin and landing a successful hit that deals nine damage, killing the goblin instantly. With only the bugbear remaining, Ash makes a second attack, hitting the bugbear and causing six damage. The bugbear taunts Ash, asking if that’s all he’s got, to which Ash replies, “We ain’t done yet, Hoss.”

**Stormwind’s Guiding Bolt (3:01:14 - 3:03:08)**
Stormwind steps up next, aiming a Guiding Bolt at the bugbear’s head. He rolls for an attack but misses, much to the party’s dismay. Despite the missed attack, the wolves remain determined to fight. However, the wolves' attacks are also ineffective against the bugbear due to their distress over the fallen comrade.

**Ghost’s Fate and Clark’s Attempt to Escape (3:03:09 - 3:04:43)**
Ghost, the wolf, lies unconscious, and the bugbear Clark tries to break free from the entanglement spell but fails. The bugbear’s failed escape attempt buys the party more time to strategize. Ash then moves his Hex to the bugbear and attacks, but the attack misses, leaving the bugbear entangled and vulnerable.

**Healing the Wolves (3:04:44 - 3:07:56)**
Stormwind decides to use his last spell slot to cast Cure Wounds on the unconscious wolf, Ghost. The healing spell successfully stabilizes Ghost, stitching his wounds and allowing him to stand, albeit limping. The wolves’ morale is boosted as they see their pack member revived.

**The Final Confrontation (3:07:57 - 3:09:39)**
The party refocuses on the bugbear Clark, who is still restrained. Bulwark and Stormageddon, the remaining wolves, continue their attacks but miss their target. The bugbear, realizing his dire situation, tries to negotiate with the party, asking what they want and why they are in his cave. The party demands information about the missing provisions and the people who were attacked.

**Interrogation and Intimidation (3:09:40 - 3:10:14)**
Clark, the bugbear, offers to reveal the identity of the one who hired him to attack the wagons and steal the provisions if the party spares his life. Ash, showing no mercy, insists on answers first. He intimidates Clark with a twenty-one on the intimidation check, making it clear that the party will not negotiate with someone responsible for such treachery.

**Interrogation and Revelation (3:10:15 - 3:12:00)**
Clark, the bugbear, intimidated by the party's relentless assault, begins to spill vital information. He reveals that his group is merely a small faction of the larger Kragmaw clan, which is based in Kragmaw Castle in Neverwinter Wood. He admits to working under King Grawl, the leader of the Kragmaw tribe, a fellow bugbear. When questioned about the whereabouts of their captured friends, Sildar and Gundren, Clark reveals that the human, Sildar, is here in the cave, while the dwarf, Gundren, was taken to Kragmaw Castle.

**Negotiation and Treachery (3:12:01 - 3:16:40)**
The party demands Clark lead them to Sildar. Clark, still hoping to negotiate for his life, agrees but asks to be released. The party, skeptical and distrustful, insists he commands his goblins to stand down first. Clark reluctantly agrees and leads them deeper into the cave. As they cross a bridge and encounter another goblin, Clark dismisses the goblin, who runs off. The group follows Clark to a den filled with goblins lounging around a fire. As they enter, Clark betrays them by shouting at the goblins to attack.

**Battle in the Den (3:16:41 - 3:20:07)**
The party quickly reacts to Clark's treachery. They manage to catch the goblins by surprise, thanks to Clark's unexpected outburst. The wolves, led by Bulwark and Stormageddon, launch their attacks but miss their initial strikes. Ash then steps in, delivering a powerful critical hit to Clark, dealing 15 damage and killing him instantly. With Clark dead, Ash turns his focus to intimidating the remaining goblins, who are now leaderless and frightened.

**Hostage Situation (3:20:08 - 3:22:49)**
The goblins, seeing their leader fall, freeze in terror. Ash demands they produce the human captive. Just as the goblins are about to comply, a hobgoblin appears from a hidden vantage point, holding Sildar at knife point. The hobgoblin threatens to kill Sildar if the party does not stand down. Ash, undeterred, places his Hex on the hobgoblin, setting the stage for a tense standoff.

**Negotiations with the Hobgoblin (3:22:51 - 3:23:59)**
Ash places a hex on the hobgoblin, making it clear that harming the human, Sildar, would be a fatal mistake. The hobgoblin, feeling the pressure, agrees to let Sildar go in exchange for his own life. He releases Sildar on the side of the cliff and begins to back away. Sildar, weakened and barely able to move, lies there as the party assesses the situation. The goblins, frightened and disorganized, do not attack.

**Retrieving Sildar (3:24:00 - 3:25:50)**
The party considers how to retrieve Sildar safely. They notice a set of steps leading up to the ledge where Sildar is lying. Ash, with his superior strength, assists Sildar down the steps. The hobgoblin, seizing the opportunity, carefully navigates around the party and makes his escape down the path with the piled rubble. The party lets him go, issuing a stern warning that they will find him if the provisions are disturbed.

**Healing and Gathering Provisions (3:25:51 - 3:27:09)**
With the immediate threat gone, the party focuses on healing Sildar. They use their remaining healing abilities to restore Sildar to a functional state, allowing him to walk on his own. They then turn their attention to the provisions scattered throughout the cave. Sildar identifies his armor and weapons among the supplies, and the party helps him gather his belongings.

**Discussion and Departure (3:27:10 - 3:30:00)**
Sildar, now equipped and more stable, thanks the party for their rescue. He informs them that Gundren has been taken to Cragmaw Castle, located somewhere in the vast Neverwinter Woods. Despite the size of the woods, the party resolves to find the castle and rescue Gundren. They decide to return to Phandalin first to rest and regroup. Sildar agrees that returning to Phandalin with the provisions is the best course of action.

**Travel to Phandalin (3:30:01 - 3:33:02)**
The journey back to Phandalin is uneventful. The sun has not yet set as they approach the town, allowing them to see the buildings and remnants of old structures. They head towards Barton's Provisions, the designated delivery point for their supplies. The party discusses the need for a long rest to recover from their ordeals and plan their next steps.

**Arriving at Phandalin and Delivering Provisions (3:33:16 - 3:34:38)**
The party arrives at Phandalin and pulls their wagon up to Barthen's Provisions. Entering the store, they are greeted by Elmar Barthen, the proprietor. After some initial banter about wrist blades, Aurora takes charge, announcing they are there to deliver provisions from Gundren. Barthen is delighted to see them and asks if they encountered any trouble on their journey. Aurora mentions they had a minor hiccup but managed to deliver the goods safely.

**Negotiating Payment (3:34:39 - 3:36:23)**
Barthen recalls the agreed payment of 20 gold pieces per escort, initially offering payment for the three present members. Aurora insists on payment for the entire group, including those who are not present. After some persuasive negotiation, Barthen agrees to pay for all members and hands over a purse containing 120 gold pieces.

**Seeking Accommodation (3:36:24 - 3:38:00)**
The party inquires about a place to rest. Barthen recommends the Stonehill Inn and offers to speak to the innkeeper about giving them a discount for their first night. They also ask about wrist blades and weapons, but Barthen informs them that they might find what they need at the Lion's Shield Coster, although it might be closed for the day. Barthen then offers to escort them to the inn after closing up his shop.

**Settling at the Stonehill Inn (3:38:01 - 3:41:56)**
Barthen walks the party to the Stonehill Inn, calling out to his workers to unload the wagon in the meantime. Arriving at the inn, Barthen introduces the party to the innkeeper, Toblen Stonehill. He explains that the party safely delivered the much-needed provisions. Toblen expresses his gratitude and offers them rooms for the night at no charge, mentioning that they can discuss extended stay rates if needed.

**Resting in Phandalin (3:41:56 - 3:42:21)**
As the group settles into Phandalin, one of the characters chooses to sleep in a barn rather than the comfortable beds offered at the inn. They express a preference for this, having been a runaway and feeling safer in such rustic accommodations. Meanwhile, the rest of the party opts for the more comfortable beds at the Stonehill Inn.

**Making Camp (3:42:22 - 3:43:55)**
Those still traveling with the wolves discuss their plans. They decide to continue walking through the night since they have night vision, opting not to set up camp. There’s some light-hearted banter about the wolves and their noisy nature in the forest. The travelers plan to meet up with the rest of the party in Phandalin, intending to find a room at the inn and bring the wolves along.

**Returning to the Inn (3:43:56 - 3:45:11)**
By the time the travelers with the wolves arrive back in Phandalin, everyone else is already asleep. They will discuss the wolves and their arrangements in the next session. One player humorously suggests they might encounter a giant on their way back, ready for another fight.

**Leveling Up and Attendance (3:45:12 - 3:45:33)**
The Dungeon Master (DM) addresses some housekeeping issues, mentioning the importance of regular attendance for earning experience points (XP). A player who missed a session is generously granted level 2 status to keep pace with the rest of the group. The DM emphasizes that frequent absences could lead to falling behind in XP.

**Group Dynamics and Schedule (3:45:34 - 3:46:04)**
The session concludes with the DM and players discussing the frequency of their game sessions. The DM acknowledges the challenges of daily play and suggests maintaining a consistent schedule that accommodates most players. The session wraps up with a brief exchange about the background music used during combat, indicating the DM’s attention to creating an immersive experience.
