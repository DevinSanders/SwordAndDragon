<br><br><br><br><br><br>The session begins with casual conversation among the participants. Speaker 1 clarifies they are not sharing a specific link, prompting Speaker 2 to check on the privacy of the conversation. Speaker 1 shares they have learned a lot about Batman, leading Speaker 3 to ask if it is about the original Batman from the 1970s. The conversation then turns to a humorous discussion about a person named Richard, who is described as resembling the Adam West-era Batman. They make light-hearted comments about Richard's eccentric habits, such as setting up a camera for pictures, wearing cargo shorts, and his karaoke setup.<br><br>The group continues discussing Richard's peculiar habits, particularly his fondness for wearing a Batman costume and using a smoke machine outside on weekends. They speculate about his activities, including hosting events with a karaoke machine and a smoke machine. The conversation reveals their curiosity about Richard's schedule and his habit of wearing the Batman costume. Speaker 4 expresses reluctance to let Richard know they are aware of his activities, while Speaker 2 suggests contacting Richard through social media to offer him a job related to an upcoming event.<br><br>The conversation shifts to a detailed description of the Dungeons and Dragons (D&amp;D) campaign setting in the city of Neverwinter. The city is bustling with early morning activities as merchants set up their stalls. The scene describes preparations for a journey with a supply wagon destined for Phandalin, overseen by Gundren Rockseeker, a robust dwarf, and Sildar Hallwinter, a seasoned warrior. The players are tasked with guarding the wagon against potential threats such as orcs and goblins, with a promise of 20 gold pieces upon successful delivery. The conversation includes a discussion on the value of the payment, the primary objective of ensuring the safe arrival of the supplies, and the need for someone to take charge during the journey.<br><br>The group discusses their roles and who should take the lead in their adventure. Speaker 3 suggests determining the leader based on charisma, leading to a humorous exchange about their respective charisma levels. The group hesitates to nominate a leader, eventually deciding to work together and support each other, with Speaker 6 agreeing to make final calls when necessary. They continue to discuss their current location, the city of Neverwinter, and the journey ahead to Phandalin, mentioning the route through the Sword Mountains. The speakers express concern about potential dangers and discuss gathering more information about the journey.<br><br>The conversation concludes with detailed information about the route from Neverwinter to Phandalin. The journey is described as a several days' trip along the high road, turning onto a trail near the Neverwinter Wood and passing by the Sword Mountains. The speakers discuss the lack of towns along the route and express interest in speaking with locals to gather more information about the journey. The conversation emphasizes the group's preparation and understanding of the risks involved in their mission.<br><br>The participants talk about their characters and resources in the game. Speaker 1 mentions an app that scans and reads text aloud, while Speaker 2 acknowledges missing something. The conversation shifts to the availability of shops in Neverwinter, a large city where anything can be found. The group discusses their in-game money, with Speaker 2 having 10 silver and Speaker 1 mistakenly claiming to have 80 gold, leading to a brief debate about character setup and starting equipment.<br><br>The group clarifies the type of provisions they are carrying, which include salted meat and ale in a keg. They humorously discuss the oddity of sending salted meat instead of fresh vegetables and fruits. The discussion also touches on farms and orchards in Fanghorn, highlighting the sources of food in the game. Speaker 6 expresses concern about potential dangers, wanting to know more about what they might encounter on their journey.<br><br>Speaker 1 provides information about potential dangers, mentioning orc and goblin raids, as well as sightings of manticores and owlbears. Although no one has reported attacks by these creatures, their presence is noted. Speaker 6, being new to such dangers, inquires about environmental clues to watch for, leading to a brief exchange on how their characters would handle these threats. The group decides to gather more information from locals before setting out.<br><br>Speaker 1 outlines the primary road from Neverwinter to Waterdeep, noting it is well-traveled and relatively safe. The group discusses their travel arrangements, with some choosing to ride in the wagon pulled by oxen and others walking alongside. There is a humorous discussion about walking speeds, flying abilities, and the practicality of using various skills and spells during the journey. The group debates their roles and responsibilities, ensuring someone will drive the wagon while others keep lookout.<br><br>The conversation reveals the extensive experience of some players, particularly Speaker 3, who has been playing Dungeons and Dragons for over 30 years. This leads to a discussion about the leadership role in the game, with Speaker 3 expressing a preference not to run the game. Speaker 1 reassures that the character setup is under control. As the group sets out, they detail their positions, with some taking to the air for scouting and others riding or walking with the wagon.<br><br>The group embarks on their journey, experiencing uneventful travel for the first few days. They encounter travelers and scouting parties returning to Neverwinter. During this time, Speaker 3 realizes a mistake in their character setup, specifically regarding the distribution of wisdom and charisma. They note the need to adjust this to ensure the correct spells and abilities for the next turn. The group's travel continues smoothly, setting the stage for the next part of their adventure.<br><br>The conversation starts with a humorous reflection on deja vu moments and a previous discussion about tracking hit points and armor class (AC). Speaker 6 mentions a vivid deja vu moment, and Speaker 2 recalls a dream where similar conversations occurred. The group discusses leadership roles again, with Speaker 5 suggesting that Pab takes the lead, despite Speaker 2's reluctance due to negative charisma. Speaker 1 jokes about Napoleon syndrome, and the group laughs about the height differences between the characters.<br><br>The party travels along the high road for four days before encountering a rutted trail leading towards the woods and mountains, known as the Tri-board Trail. They turn onto it and travel for several more hours. The narrative does not detail daily stops and camping. As they round a bend, they spot two dead horses with arrows sticking out of them. Speaker 5, who was flying ahead, and Speaker 6, who was walking, notice the horses first.<br><br>The group decides to investigate the scene cautiously. Speaker 1 explains the positions and actions of the characters. The party stops the wagon and prepares for potential danger. Speaker 4 takes flight to keep a lookout, while others stay back to observe. The scene is described as having a steep ravine on one side of the trail and bushes on the other. Speaker 2 moves towards the bushes to stay hidden while investigating.<br><br>As Speaker 2 approaches the bushes, they discover goblins hiding inside. The goblins, focused on the rest of the group, do not immediately notice Speaker 2. The group prepares for combat, with everyone rolling for initiative. Speaker 1 describes the scene near the horses, noting an opened leather map case and saddlebags, indicating the horses were robbed. The goblins are crouched and watching the party, setting the stage for the impending battle. The group rolls their initiatives, with each player stating their results. Speaker 2 expresses excitement about potential sneak attack damage.<br><br>As the group prepares for battle, Speaker 3 briefly discusses the use of a doubling cube for backgammon, highlighting a different type of game they play. The group is ready to face the goblins, having rolled their initiatives and prepared their characters for the encounter.<br><br>The conversation continues with the group preparing for combat. Speaker 2 jokes about rolling a doubling cube, humorously referring to a game called Zombie Attacks. Speaker 1 instructs Speaker 2 to perform a stealth check, resulting in a combined roll of 14 with stealth proficiency. Speaker 1 explains that Speaker 2 is the only one not surprised by the goblins. Speaker 2 prepares to sprint towards the goblins, indicating an imminent attack.<br><br>Speaker 2 spots two goblins crouching in the bushes. He decides to attack the closest one using his rapier. The group discusses using temporary items for creatures in the game. Speaker 2 rolls a 20, resulting in a critical hit. He rolls for damage, dealing 15 points and killing the goblin with a stab through the skull. The second goblin, now aware of the attack, cries out in shock. Speaker 3 mentions the presence of more goblins and a hobgoblin, indicating further challenges ahead.<br><br>Speaker 2 continues his turn by kicking the slain goblin off his rapier and shouting a warning to the group. The other characters are alerted to the presence of goblins. There is a humorous debate about the mechanics of using a rapier and the physical strength required for certain actions. Speaker 2 decides to stay low and move stealthily, finding cover while maintaining alertness.<br><br>Speaker 1 clarifies the distance between the wagon and the horses, indicating it is about 50 feet. Speaker 2 moves back towards the wagon, staying hidden in the bushes. The group discusses the rules for hiding and breaking line of sight, with Speaker 1 explaining that a halfling can use a creature one size larger for cover. Speaker 2 plans his movements carefully, considering the presence of other goblins and aiming to maintain stealth.<br><br>Speaker 2 mentions carrying 1000 ball bearings, planning to use them strategically. There is a lighthearted discussion about the weight of the character and the feasibility of being lifted. Speaker 2 finishes his turn, having moved back 25 feet and staying in cover without being in stealth. Speaker 1 indicates that the nearby goblin, although surprised, has seen Speaker 2. The group remains prepared for the next phase of combat, ready to face the remaining goblins and potential threats.<br><br>As the battle progresses, the group moves into the second round. Speaker 1 explains that the goblin next to the one Speaker 2 attacked is now targeting him. The group discusses the mechanics of surprise in combat, where surprised characters cannot take any actions on their first turn. With the initial surprise over, the goblin swings its scimitar at Speaker 2 but misses due to fear and Speaker 2’s quick movement. Speaker 2 prepares for his turn, confirming his visibility to the goblin.<br><br>Speaker 2 assesses the situation, noting that other goblins have yet to emerge from hiding. He decides to attack the goblin with a crossbow from a distance, hoping to remain unnoticed by the others. He successfully hits the goblin, dealing significant damage. The group discusses the mechanics of adding dexterity to damage rolls, ensuring Speaker 2 understands how to calculate his attack’s effectiveness.<br><br>The goblin drops after being hit by Speaker 2’s crossbow bolt. Speaker 2 remains cautious, staying hidden in the bushes to avoid detection. The group discusses the width of the trail and the bushes, confirming that the remaining goblins know the direction of the attack but cannot see Speaker 2. They strategize about the next moves, considering the positions and possible actions of the remaining goblins.<br><br>The group delves into the mechanics of stealth and sneak attacks, discussing how to use cover effectively. Speaker 1 explains the layout of the trail and the ambush setup. Speaker 2 asks about the campaign’s origin, with Speaker 1 mentioning that it is primarily based on a module with some modifications. They also discuss the need for more supplies and tools for future sessions, planning to bring additional resources like a battle map grid.<br><br>Another goblin emerges from the bushes, holding a bow. It knows the general direction of Speaker 2’s attack but cannot see him. The goblin decides to shoot at Speaker 5, but the arrow bounces off his shield. A second archer appears and targets Ignatius, resulting in a critical hit. The group discusses the implications of dual-wielding shields and the mechanics of critical hits, joking about the effectiveness of their defensive strategies. Speaker 2 acknowledges the role of the healer in keeping the group alive, emphasizing the importance of staying near the healer during combat.<br><br>The group continues its battle against the goblins and a hobgoblin. Speaker 4 remarks on their ability to keep each other alive, reinforcing their strategy. The hobgoblin rolls a 19 for an attack on Speaker 5, dealing minimal damage due to the natural armor, hitting him in the arm. The discussion emphasizes the importance of staying hidden and avoiding damage, especially for characters with low health. Speaker 5 highlights the challenge of survival with minimal health points.<br><br>Speaker 3 decides to attack the hobgoblin twice but misses both times. Frustrated, he attempts to intimidate the enemy, only for the hobgoblin to laugh at him. The group jokes about their dice rolls and considers using a "dice jail" for bad rolls. They strategize about the next moves, with Speaker 6 noting their need to be cautious and efficient in their actions.<br><br>Speaker 7 considers his flying speed and the distance to the enemy, realizing he cannot engage in melee but can use a spell. He decides to use "Entangle" on the hobgoblin, effectively restraining it. The group discusses the spellcasting mechanics, including proficiency and wisdom bonuses. The spellcasting ability of the characters becomes a focal point as they plan their next moves.<br><br>The "Entangle" spell affects a 20-foot area, requiring all creatures within to make a strength saving throw. Both the hobgoblin and nearby characters must beat a DC of 14. Speaker 3 humorously notes that the plants avoid him, ensuring he is not affected by the spell. The group appreciates the effectiveness of the spell, acknowledging its impact on the battlefield.<br><br>Speaker 5 uses his breath weapon, a 15-foot cone of fire, requiring enemies to make a DC 12 dexterity saving throw. The hobgoblin and goblins manage to save, taking only half damage. Speaker 5 rolls for damage, resulting in minimal impact but still singeing the enemies. The group jokes about the effectiveness of the attack and its dramatic flair.<br><br>The hobgoblin and goblins, despite taking minor damage, remain a threat. Speaker 5 uses a tempestuous magic ability to fly 10 feet in the air, seeking a better vantage point and safety. The group prepares for the next round of combat, discussing their positions and potential actions to gain the upper hand in the ongoing battle.<br><br>The group discusses the effectiveness of their recent attacks, with Speaker 1 confirming that the hobgoblin and two goblin archers were hit by the breath weapon but only took half damage due to their successful saving throws. The hobgoblin, restrained by magical vines, failed its saving throw and took full damage. The characters strategize about their next moves, evaluating the number of enemies left and their current conditions.<br><br>Speaker 1 describes the battlefield, noting the hobgoblin restrained by magical vines. Speaker 5 confirms that the breath weapon did not burn the vines. The players discuss the mechanics of the spell and the surroundings, ensuring they understand the effects of the spell and their current positioning. Speaker 5 clarifies his flying ability, Tempestuous Magic, which allows him to avoid opportunity attacks.<br><br>Speaker 6 attacks the hobgoblin but misses, even with a crossbow shot. The group jokes about the hobgoblin's high armor class (AC) and the difficulty in landing hits. Speaker 1 clarifies that the hobgoblin is not using a shield but still has a high AC due to wearing chainmail. The conversation highlights the challenge of fighting a well-armored enemy and the importance of strategic positioning.<br><br>The group debates the hobgoblin's equipment, speculating about its armor and shield. They express interest in acquiring the hobgoblin's gear once it is defeated. Speaker 3 confirms that the hobgoblin's AC is high due to its armor and shield, which aligns with the game's rules. The players strategize about the best approach to take down the hobgoblin, considering its defenses and their available abilities.<br><br>The group humorously discusses their approach to the game, emphasizing a "murder hobo" mentality focused on defeating enemies and acquiring loot. They joke about being an "angry bird" and the need for teamwork despite playful rivalries. The camaraderie and banter highlight the fun and engaging nature of their Dungeons and Dragons campaign, as they navigate the challenges of combat and strategize for future encounters.<br><br>The players continue strategizing, sharing laughter and light-hearted comments about their roles. Speaker 1 announces Asa's turn. Speaker 7 confirms a hit on the hobgoblin, which is now restrained and cries out in pain.<br><br>Speaker 2 rolls for a crossbow shot but misses, despite having a +5 bonus. The group clarifies that Speaker 2 did not use the hide action, meaning his attack was not a sneak attack. Speaker 1 explains the mechanics of sneak attacks and hiding, emphasizing the importance of using the hide action or having the cunning action ability at higher levels.<br><br>The group discusses the disadvantage of firing into melee, where others are engaged in close combat. Speaker 1 clarifies the line of sight and the firing angle, noting that Speaker 2 had a clear shot. They joke about needing miniatures and battle maps to better visualize the battlefield. Speaker 1 mentions plans to print miniatures and bring more supplies for future sessions.<br><br>The hobgoblin, still restrained by vines, attempts to break free but fails. The two goblin archers, seeing their boss tied up and the attacks continuing, decide to flee. The group jokes about the goblins running away, and Speaker 3 encourages "Bird boy" to chase them.<br><br>Speaker 3 attacks the hobgoblin, delivering a critical miss followed by a successful hit that deals 7 damage. The group describes the attack, where the hobgoblin's skull is crushed with a shield. They humorously discuss the hobgoblin's gear, particularly his chainmail, and whether it was damaged in the attack.<br><br>Speaker 3 jokes about wielding three shields and turning into a Ninja Turtle, while Speaker 1 explains that additional shields will not provide more AC bonuses. They discuss the feasibility of using the hobgoblin's gear and the benefits of having different types of shields for various combat situations. The conversation shifts to the importance of strategic positioning and gear optimization.<br><br>The players continue their humorous banter, discussing unrelated topics like state couples and playful jokes. Speaker 3 mentions running after the fleeing goblins, indicating the next phase of their combat encounter.<br><br>The group discusses the implications of difficult terrain created by the magical vines, which slow down movement. Speaker 3 acknowledges the reduced movement, agreeing to move 15 feet in anger towards the fleeing goblins. There's some back and forth about whether the fire breath affected the vines, concluding that it did not since they are magical.<br><br>Speaker 7 starts flying straight after the two goblin archers who are running away. They discuss the goblins' speed, comparing it to a halfling’s. The players clarify that the goblins' movements are unaffected by the difficult terrain since they were not in the vine area. <br><br>The players decide to cast Entangle again to slow down the goblins. Speaker 4 releases concentration on the previous vines and successfully casts the spell on the fleeing goblins. One goblin is entangled, while the other manages to escape. This effectively halves the movement of the entangled goblin.<br><br>Speaker 5 attempts to use Firebolt on the free goblin but critically misses. Aurora (Speaker 7) then successfully hits the moving goblin with a roll of 15, causing the goblin to fall dead. The remaining goblin is now the only target left, tangled in the vines.<br><br>Ace (Speaker 2) asks about his crossbow’s range and confirms it can shoot up to 320 feet with disadvantage. He calculates the distance to the entangled goblin and decides to move closer, mentioning the idea of hopping on another character’s back to move faster. The group humorously considers the logistics of this tactic.<br><br>Ace attempts to jump on Speaker 3’s back while firing his crossbow. This leads to a humorous and chaotic scene where Speaker 3 considers grappling Ace to stop him. They both roll strength checks to determine if Ace can successfully jump onto his back and fire the crossbow simultaneously. The tension rises as they prepare to roll.<br><br>Ace (Speaker 2) tries to jump onto Mike (Speaker 3), resulting in a contested strength check. Ace gets a 15, but Mike gets an 11. Despite winning the check, Mike is resistant to being used as a mount, leading to a humorous exchange about the propriety and practicality of such an attempt.<br><br>After the failed ride attempt, Ace ends up prone. Mike continues to focus on the goblin, delivering a powerful attack that results in the goblin's death through internal injuries. The players humorously discuss the brutal nature of the attack, emphasizing the physical damage done.<br><br>With all enemies defeated, the players begin to search the bodies for loot. They find basic items: chainmail, a shield, bows, and scimitars. They humorously debate the practicality of the loot, especially the chainmail. The footprints and drag marks indicate that this ambush party was part of a larger group, and the horses appear to belong to Gundren and Sildar.<br><br>The party discusses the mechanics of sneak attacks and the path to becoming a high-level assassin. They also talk about how wearing armor affects different classes. The Dungeon Master announces that the characters have gained enough experience points to level up to level two, bringing excitement to the group. They consider taking a short rest to recharge abilities like the breath weapon.<br><br>The players joke about the absence of a party member due to health issues and discuss the new abilities and options available at level two, including action moments and spellcasting. The session ends with a mix of logistical planning and light-hearted banter, reflecting the group's camaraderie and enjoyment of the game.<br><br>The players discuss the mechanics of hiding in the game. Speaker 2 questions how hiding works after a previous scenario where they hid behind a corner but were still spotted by zombies. The Dungeon Master (Speaker 1) explains that for a character to remain hidden, there must be something obstructing the line of sight or darkness. Hiding in plain sight or in daylight without such obstructions does not prevent enemies from seeing the character.<br><br>The conversation shifts to the recent leveling up to level 2. The Dungeon Master explains that leveling up required 300 experience points and emphasizes that this rapid advancement is not typical. Speaker 3 humorously shares a story about their character's dual shields, which initially were to do 1d8 damage each but were negotiated down to 1d4. This story highlights the balance between character creativity and game mechanics.<br><br>Mike (Speaker 3) notices trail marks and footprints where the goblins dragged their loot. His character’s passive perception allows him to easily spot these details. The group decides to take a short rest, which lasts about an hour, to regain some abilities and spell slots. The short rest helps the characters prepare for the next part of their journey.<br><br>During the short rest, the players discuss the benefits they gain from it, such as recovering a spell slot or a breath weapon. The Dungeon Master clarifies that a short rest does not automatically heal hit points unless they use hit dice. The conversation includes a humorous exchange about the necessity of rest and the practicality of their healer's spells.<br><br>As the group prepares to continue their journey, they discuss different ways to create light since they might travel after dark. Options range from using breath weapons to ignite torches to casting spells like Prestidigitation or using cantrips like Firebolt. This leads to a discussion about their spells and abilities, ensuring they are well-prepared for the night.<br><br>The session resumes with a discussion about various spells and abilities. Speaker 6 mentions the "Toll the Dead" spell, explaining its damage mechanics and wisdom saving throw requirement. There's some humorous back-and-forth about the effectiveness and aesthetics of the spell. The group then talks about different ways to create light using their abilities, but Speaker 1 reminds them that it is still midday and there is no immediate need for light.<br><br>The party debates whether to follow the trail towards Phandalin or the one where the goblins dragged something into the woods. They discuss their mission to deliver provisions to Phandalin and the fact that their employers, Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter, might be in danger. The Dungeon Master clarifies that the trail towards Phandalin is about a half-day's journey and they can reach it before nightfall. Ultimately, the group decides to follow the dragging trail to potentially rescue their employers.<br><br>As they prepare to follow the dragging trail, the party considers splitting up. Some members suggest staying with the wagon while others scout ahead. The group debates the merits of stealth and strength, and who should go into the woods. Speaker 4 jokes about riding on another character's back, which is quickly dismissed. They ultimately decide on a plan to investigate the trail together while being cautious.<br><br>The conversation shifts to clarifying how leveling up affects their hit points. The Dungeon Master explains that leveling up increases their maximum HP but doesn't automatically heal them. The players discuss their current health statuses and consider using healing spells. There's a brief mix-up about how many hit points were gained and lost, but it gets resolved.<br><br>Towards the end of the session, the conversation becomes more casual, touching on topics like sports and current events. The players mention a recent rule change and a golfer who was in the news. This light-hearted banter provides a break before they dive back into the game.<br><br>The group continues their casual conversation about recent news involving the Louisville PD and the PGA's response to an incident. They then shift back to the game, with Speaker 3 declaring readiness with their prepared spell list. There is a brief moment of humor about marshmallows and the time of day.<br><br>The party members discuss their roles and abilities, particularly focusing on stealth. Speaker 2 claims to be the best scout, while others debate this based on their passive perception scores. They ultimately decide to split the party: some members will follow the goblin trail, while others will escort the wagon to ensure their mission is completed.<br><br>The party splits into two groups. The group following the goblin trail travels through the woods for about an hour before arriving at a clearing with a hillside and a cave entrance. A small stream flows out of the cave. They observe goblin footprints leading into the cave.<br><br>As they approach the cave, they hear snarling and growling. Inside, they spot animals, likely wolves or dogs, chained up near the entrance. The animals grow more agitated as the party comes closer. Speaker 4 uses the "Speak with Animals" spell to communicate, discovering that the animals are being trained by goblins and are aggressive towards intruders.<br><br>While Speaker 4 communicates with the animals, the rest of the party examines their surroundings. They find a crevice leading upwards with light shining down but no other clear exits. They realize they must either find a way to bypass the aggressive animals or continue following the stream deeper into the cave. The animals, although chained, pose a threat if the party gets too close.<br><br>Speaker 4 uses their animal handling skills to calm the wolves, who are initially aggressive and wary of the party's presence. After successfully rolling a 15 on the animal handling check, the wolves become more relaxed. The wolves, still agitated but willing to communicate, question the party's intentions. They explain they are following goblin footprints that might lead them to their friends, Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter. The wolves mention that some of their masters returned recently but cannot provide specific details about numbers. The party then persuades the wolves, offering them better treatment and freedom in exchange for their help in finding their friends.<br><br>The party continues to persuade the wolves by promising them food and better living conditions. With a persuasion roll of 19, the wolves agree to help if the party frees them. Speaker 4, assisted by Speaker 3, breaks the chains binding the wolves with a successful strength check. The wolves now have collars with a length of chain still attached but are otherwise free.<br><br>The party introduces themselves to the wolves, who ask what the party wants them to do next. Speaker 4 introduces themselves as StormWing and inquires about the wolves' names and any distinguishing features. The wolves, now allies, are ready to assist the party as they continue their quest to find Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter. Meanwhile, the rest of the party, who split off earlier, continues their journey towards Phandalin, unaware of the new allies the others have gained.<br><br>The party, having successfully calmed the wolves, decides to adopt them as companions. The wolves, who had no names, were given names by the party: Stormageddon, Bulwark, and Ghost. The wolves show interest in wearing armor and learning to fly, although they lack wings. The party discusses how to modify chain mail to fit the wolves, realizing they would need an armorer’s help for proper adjustments. The wolves are excited about the new prospects, indicating their willingness to follow and assist the party.<br><br>The party, through Speaker 4, asks the wolves about their knowledge of commands like follow, stop, attack, and come back. The wolves, trained by goblins, know basic commands and are eager to assist further. The party then asks the wolves to lead them to their former masters and any possible captives. The wolves inform the party that their masters are further up in the cave and offer to guide them.<br><br>Accompanied by the wolves, the party moves deeper into the cave. They hear snarling and growling as they advance, indicating more creatures ahead. The wolves express their willingness to assist, as long as they receive treats like steak. The party humorously discusses their situation, including plans to get gas and the operating hours of local gas stations, adding a light-hearted touch to their adventure.<br><br>As they proceed, the party ensures they have enough light to navigate the cave, while the wolves rely on their dark vision. The Dungeon Master indicates that the wolves will guide the party through the cave towards the goblin masters. The party discusses their plans to continue exploring and ensures everyone is prepared for the challenges ahead.<br><br>The party, led by the wolves, continues deeper into the cave alongside the stream. The wolves stop and indicate that many of their former masters are ahead, along with their big master further into the cave. They encounter a bridge indicating an upper level to the cave and start ascending rough stone stairs. At the top, they find three goblins resting by pools of water feeding the stream. The goblins are startled by the sight of the wolves, who were supposed to be chained, and rise to confront the party.<br><br>Realizing they have the element of surprise, the party decides to attack the goblins. Initiative is rolled, and the party, along with the wolves, prepare for battle. Stormwing, one of the wolves, acts first, followed by the goblins, the rest of the wolves, and the party members. The first action taken by the party is a powerful Guiding Bolt cast by Speaker 4, which explodes a goblin on impact.<br><br>As the goblins react, they question the wolves' loyalty, but the wolves remain on the party’s side. The goblins attempt to strike the wolves but miss. The wolves, empowered by pack tactics, retaliate. Bulwark, one of the wolves, lands a critical hit, causing significant damage and nearly decapitating a goblin. This display of power from the wolves boosts the party's morale as they continue their assault.<br><br>Following Bulwark's attack, the remaining wolves, Stormageddon and Ghost, take their turns. Stormageddon successfully mauls another goblin, eliminating the threat. The party discusses tactics and checks the remaining goblins. With two goblins already down, the battle continues with confidence as the party coordinates their efforts to clear the remaining enemies.<br><br>After successfully mauling another goblin, the wolves receive praise from the party. Speaker 3 provides strips of meat as a reward, ensuring the wolves remain loyal and well-fed. Speaker 1 mentions that the goblin chainmail could potentially be modified to fit the wolves, making them even more formidable. The party members joke about the wolves’ honor and loyalty, appreciating their new companions.<br><br>The wolves lead the party further into the cave. They encounter a smoldering fire, providing dim light. The area is littered with provisions, chests, crates, clothes, tools, and kegs of ale from previous wagons, likely the ones Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter had asked the party to protect. Close to the fire are a few goblins and a bugbear, along with another wolf that starts growling to alert the goblins and bugbear of the party's presence.<br><br>The new wolf, loyal to the bugbear, questions the other wolves about their chains and their alliance with the intruders. The party’s wolves respond, explaining that the party are their new masters who provide better food and care. They even mention getting belly rubs and ear scratches, which convinces the new wolf of their loyalty.<br><br>The bugbear, recognized as the big master, prepares for combat. The new wolf, feeling betrayed, vows to fight alongside the bugbear against the party and their wolves. Initiative is rolled again, and the three party wolves get to go first. Bulwark leads the attack, quickly mauling the opposing wolf with a critical hit. The remaining party wolves join in, swiftly eliminating the threat. With the enemy wolf down, the party prepares to confront the bugbear and the remaining goblins.<br><br>As the battle rages on, the third wolf attempts to attack a goblin but misses. The bugbear, seeing his pet defeated, snarls and commands the goblins to handle the intruders while he tries to escape through a crevice at the back of the room. He moves swiftly but doesn't attack, focusing on his retreat.<br>The goblins, now alert and ready to fight, take their turn. Both rolled a 17 for initiative, placing them high in the order. They decide to attack the wolves. The first goblin strikes a wolf with a scimitar, causing a deep gash and severe damage, but the wolf survives the hit. The second goblin follows up, attacking the same wolf, which succumbs to the wounds and falls unconscious.<br><br>Ash steps up next, casting Hex on the goblin that killed the wolf, placing a curse on it and dealing extra necrotic damage with each hit. He then attacks the cursed goblin, landing a hit and obliterating it. Ash then targets the remaining goblin but misses his second attack.<br><br>The remaining wolves are given commands to either heal their fallen comrade or pursue the bugbear. Speaker 4 decides to use Entangle to prevent the bugbear from escaping. The bugbear, halfway through the crevice, gets entangled and stuck, unable to move further.<br><br>The wolves, visibly upset about their fallen comrade, struggle to focus and fail to land effective attacks on the remaining goblins. The bugbear, trapped in the crevice, attempts to break free but remains stuck due to the entanglement and his large size. The remaining goblin attacks Ash but misses, leaving him unharmed.<br><br>The fight continues as Ash takes his turn, moving the Hex to the remaining goblin and landing a successful hit that deals nine damage, killing the goblin instantly. With only the bugbear remaining, Ash makes a second attack, hitting the bugbear and causing six damage. The bugbear taunts Ash, asking if that’s all he’s got, to which Ash replies, “We ain’t done yet, Hoss.”<br><br>StormWing steps up next, aiming a Guiding Bolt at the bugbear’s head. He rolls for an attack but misses, much to the party’s dismay. Despite the missed attack, the wolves remain determined to fight. However, the wolves' attacks are also ineffective against the bugbear due to their distress over the fallen comrade.<br><br>Ghost, the wolf, lies unconscious, and the bugbear Clark tries to break free from the entanglement spell but fails. The bugbear’s failed escape attempt buys the party more time to strategize. Ash then moves his Hex to the bugbear and attacks, but the attack misses, leaving the bugbear entangled and vulnerable.<br><br>StormWing decides to use his last spell slot to cast Cure Wounds on the unconscious wolf, Ghost. The healing spell successfully stabilizes Ghost, stitching his wounds and allowing him to stand, albeit limping. The wolves’ morale is boosted as they see their pack member revived.<br><br>The party refocuses on the bugbear Clark, who is still restrained. Bulwark and Stormageddon, the remaining wolves, continue their attacks but miss their target. Realizing his dire situation, the bugbear attempts to negotiate with the party, asking what they want and why they are in his cave. The party demands information about the missing provisions and the people who were attacked.<br><br>Clark, the bugbear, offers to reveal the identity of the one who hired him to attack the wagons and steal the provisions if the party spares his life. Ash, showing no mercy, insists on answers first. He intimidates Clark with a twenty-one on the intimidation check, making it clear that the party will not negotiate with someone responsible for such treachery.<br><br>Clark, intimidated by the party's relentless assault, begins to spill vital information. He reveals that his group is merely a small faction of the larger Cragmaw clan, which is based in Cragmaw Castle in Neverwinter Wood. He admits to working under King Grol, the leader of the Cragmaw tribe, a fellow bugbear. When questioned about the whereabouts of their captured friends, Sildar and Gundren, Clark reveals that the human, Sildar, is here in the cave, while the dwarf, Gundren, was taken to Cragmaw Castle.<br><br>The party demands Clark lead them to Sildar. Clark, still hoping to negotiate for his life, agrees but asks to be released. The party, skeptical and distrustful, insists he commands his goblins to stand down first. Clark reluctantly agrees and leads them deeper into the cave. As they cross a bridge and encounter another goblin, Clark dismisses the goblin, who runs off. The group follows Clark to a den filled with goblins lounging around a fire. As they enter, Clark betrays them by shouting at the goblins to attack.<br><br>The party quickly reacts to Clark's treachery. They manage to catch the goblins by surprise, thanks to Clark's unexpected outburst. The wolves, led by Bulwark and Stormageddon, launch their attacks but miss their initial strikes. Ash then steps in, delivering a powerful critical hit to Clark, dealing 15 damage and killing him instantly. With Clark dead, Ash turns his focus to intimidating the remaining goblins, who are now leaderless and frightened.<br><br>The goblins, seeing their leader fall, freeze in terror. Ash demands they produce the human captive. Just as the goblins are about to comply, a hobgoblin appears from a hidden vantage point, holding Sildar at knife point. The hobgoblin threatens to kill Sildar if the party does not stand down. Ash, undeterred, places his Hex on the hobgoblin, setting the stage for a tense standoff.<br><br>Ash places a Hex on the hobgoblin, making it clear that harming Sildar would be a fatal mistake. The hobgoblin, feeling the pressure, agrees to let Sildar go in exchange for his own life. He releases Sildar on the side of the cliff and begins to back away. Sildar, weakened and barely able to move, lies there as the party assesses the situation. The goblins, frightened and disorganized, do not attack.<br><br>The party considers how to retrieve Sildar safely. They notice a set of steps leading up to the ledge where Sildar is lying. Ash, with his superior strength, assists Sildar down the steps. The hobgoblin, seizing the opportunity, carefully navigates around the party and makes his escape down the path with the piled rubble. The party lets him go, issuing a stern warning that they will find him if the provisions are disturbed.<br><br>With the immediate threat gone, the party focuses on healing Sildar. They use their remaining healing abilities to restore Sildar to a functional state, allowing him to walk on his own. They then turn their attention to the provisions scattered throughout the cave. Sildar identifies his armor and weapons among the supplies, and the party helps him gather his belongings.<br><br>Sildar, now equipped and more stable, thanks the party for their rescue. He informs them that Gundren has been taken to Cragmaw Castle, located somewhere in the vast Neverwinter Wood. Despite the size of the woods, the party resolves to find the castle and rescue Gundren. They decide to return to Phandalin first to rest and regroup. Sildar agrees that returning to Phandalin with the provisions is the best course of action.<br><br>The journey back to Phandalin is uneventful. The sun has not yet set as they approach the town, allowing them to see the buildings and remnants of old structures. They head towards Barthen's Provisions, the designated delivery point for their supplies. The party discusses the need for a long rest to recover from their ordeals and plan their next steps.<br><br>The party arrives at Phandalin and pulls their wagon up to Barthen's Provisions. Entering the store, they are greeted by Elmar Barthen, the proprietor. After some initial banter about wrist blades, Aurora takes charge, announcing they are there to deliver provisions from Gundren. Barthen is delighted to see them and asks if they encountered any trouble on their journey. Aurora mentions they had a minor hiccup but managed to deliver the goods safely.<br><br>Barthen recalls the agreed payment of 20 gold pieces per escort, initially offering payment for the three present members. Aurora insists on payment for the entire group, including those who are not present. After some persuasive negotiation, Barthen agrees to pay for all members and hands over a purse containing 120 gold pieces.<br><br>The party inquires about a place to rest. Barthen recommends the Stonehill Inn and offers to speak to the innkeeper about giving them a discount for their first night. They also ask about wrist blades and weapons, but Barthen informs them that they might find what they need at the Lion's Shield Coster, although it might be closed for the day. Barthen then offers to escort them to the inn after closing up his shop.<br><br>Barthen walks the party to the Stonehill Inn, calling out to his workers to unload the wagon in the meantime. Arriving at the inn, Barthen introduces the party to the innkeeper, Toblen Stonehill. He explains that the party safely delivered the much-needed provisions. Toblen expresses his gratitude and offers them rooms for the night at no charge, mentioning that they can discuss extended stay rates if needed.<br><br>As the group settles into Phandalin, one of the characters chooses to sleep in a barn rather than the comfortable beds offered at the inn. They express a preference for this, having been a runaway and feeling safer in such rustic accommodations. Meanwhile, the rest of the party opts for the more comfortable beds at the Stonehill Inn.<br><br>Those still traveling with the wolves discuss their plans. They decide to continue walking through the night since they have night vision, opting not to set up camp. There’s some light-hearted banter about the wolves and their noisy nature in the forest. The travelers plan to meet up with the rest of the party in Phandalin, intending to find a room at the inn and bring the wolves along.<br><br>By the time the travelers with the wolves arrive back in Phandalin, everyone else is already asleep. They will discuss the wolves and their arrangements in the next session. One player humorously suggests they might encounter a giant on their way back, ready for another fight.<br><br>The Dungeon Master (DM) addresses some housekeeping issues, mentioning the importance of regular attendance for earning experience points (XP). A player who missed a session is generously granted level 2 status to keep pace with the rest of the group. The DM emphasizes that frequent absences could lead to falling behind in XP.<br><br>The session concludes with the DM and players discussing the frequency of their game sessions. The DM acknowledges the challenges of daily play and suggests maintaining a consistent schedule that accommodates most players. The session wraps up with a brief exchange about the background music used during combat, indicating the DM’s attention to creating an immersive experience.<br>  <a data-tooltip-position="top" aria-label="2024-05-24 Redbrands Roundup" data-href="2024-05-24 Redbrands Roundup" href="https://devinsanders.github.io/SwordAndDragon/1-session-journals/2024-05-24-redbrands-roundup.html" class="internal-link data-link-icon data-link-icon-after data-link-text" target="_self" rel="noopener" data-link-tags="" data-link-path="1-Session Journals/2024-05-24 Redbrands Roundup.md" style="--data-link-path: 1-Session Journals/2024-05-24 Redbrands Roundup.md;">Next</a>  ]]></description><link>https://devinsanders.github.io/SwordAndDragon/1-session-journals/2024-05-17-the-journey-to-phandlin.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">1-Session Journals/2024-05-17 The Journey to Phandlin.md</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Devin Sanders]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 05 Jul 2024 07:27:46 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2024-05-24 Redbrands Roundup]]></title><description><![CDATA[ 
 <br><br>[Speaker 1] introduces himself humorously by stating, "My name is not Rob Auger, I'm an accountant." This is followed by a brief exchange about a fare in Nanyang that [Speaker 1] criticizes for being expensive and poorly organized. He describes the high costs for both admission and individual activities, noting that it used to be cheaper and more inclusive. [Speaker 2] shares a concern about the safety of the rides, which [Speaker 1] dismisses with a light-hearted attitude towards avoiding risky rides.<br><br>The conversation shifts to a game scenario where [Speaker 1] and [Speaker 2] discuss the progress of a quest involving rescuing a character named Sildar and recovering his equipment from a cave. They talk about traveling to Phandalin, noticing a larger trail indicating wagon routes, and reaching the town at nightfall. They describe encountering Toblin Stonehill at the Stonehill Inn, who provides them with free lodging for the night. The following morning, they prepare for the day, discussing spell preparations and the presence of wolves they have befriended. The wolves have been named Stormageddon, Ghost, and Bulwark, drawing a humorous comparison to popular media references.<br><br>The next morning, the group gathers in the common room of the inn, engaging in a humorous discussion about removing a splinter with a pistol. They banter about the origins and loyalty of the wolves, leading to a comedic explanation of how they befriended the wolves after killing the goblins who mistreated them. The conversation briefly touches on the impact of "Game of Thrones" on husky adoptions, followed by the distribution of gold among the group members.<br><br>A new character arrives at the inn, initiating confusion among the group as they discuss their prior meeting and the nature of their mission. [Speaker 1] explains that the group originally signed up for a job posting to escort a wagon of provisions to Phandalin, a task assigned by Gundren Rockseeker and Sildar Hallwinter. They detail how they met at the gate of Neverwinter and traveled together, with Gundren and Sildar riding ahead. The new arrival, who missed the initial meetup but still sought to join, is now in Phandalin and looking to assist.<br><br>The group queries the innkeeper about a blacksmith in town, only to learn there isn't a full-fledged blacksmith, just a small smithy with some basic tools. The conversation shifts to the group's future plans and a brief mention of Sildar, who is present in the room but hasn't joined their table yet. The group recognizes Sildar, and there's a discussion about his current activities and the whereabouts of Gundren, who has been taken to Cragmaw Castle.<br><br>Sildar approaches the group, thanking them for saving him. He explains that Gundren and his brothers discovered a map to a long-lost cave system believed to contain magical items, known as Wave Echo Cave. However, the map was taken with Gundren to Cragmaw Castle. Sildar asks the group if they would be willing to rescue Gundren for a reward of 100 gold pieces, but the group finds the reward insufficient given the dangers involved. They express concerns about the feasibility and risk of storming a castle, ultimately deciding against the mission.<br><br>The conversation turns lighter as the group jokes about various topics, including locking doors and facing puberty again. The arrival of a character named Rockarmor, a Goliath, introduces another dynamic. The group acknowledges him but remains focused on their breakfast and the next steps. Some members express hunger and the need to eat, while others discuss strategies and the rogue's absence. The rogue, who slept in a barn, listens in on the group's plans from outside.<br><br>As the morning progresses, the group concludes their current mission, expressing a mix of satisfaction and disappointment over their progress. They joke about their short-lived campaign and the desire to advance further. The humorous interaction continues as they address the wolves and the camaraderie built through their adventure. They acknowledge the end of their current job and prepare for new endeavors, leaving open possibilities for future campaigns and adventures.<br><br>The group continues discussing their plans and interactions, with a humorous exchange about handling the wolves and referring to them by name: Stormageddon, Bulwark, and Ghost. [Speaker 1] expresses a desire to create armor for Bulwark using goblin chainmail they had acquired. The conversation shifts to [Speaker 2] questioning the newcomer’s purpose for being there, with the newcomer admitting they’re seeking adventure and don’t have anywhere else to go. The group jokes about the newcomer's intelligence and their ability to break down doors.<br><br>A playful conflict arises when a grape is thrown at [Speaker 2]’s head, leading to a dexterity check. The group jokes about using breath weapons in response and discusses the stealth and perception checks involved in the situation. Amidst this, [Speaker 1] successfully crafts makeshift armor for Bulwark and, subsequently, for the other wolves, Ghost and Stormageddon, using the goblin chainmail. These actions involve successful sleight of hand checks, and the group celebrates the newfound armorsmithing skills.<br><br>[Speaker 1] decides to enhance his own chainmail armor, successfully modifying it to provide better coverage. The group’s banter continues as they discuss their armor and fighting capabilities. During this, some townsfolk approach and inquire if the group is in town to deal with the Red Brand Ruffians, a local gang causing trouble. The townsfolk express concern about the townmaster's inaction and suggest the group could take on the contract for a reward. The group considers this new quest, weighing it against their previous mission, and plans to visit the townmaster to negotiate terms.<br><br>As the conversation winds down, one group member, who had been absent during the wolf armory, finds food after a long night. The group, now equipped and with a potential new quest, debates their next course of action, hinting at possible future adventures and missions. The camaraderie and light-hearted interactions underscore the group's dynamic as they prepare for the challenges ahead.<br><br>The group decides to visit the townmaster's hall to negotiate terms for their next mission. They discuss their respective charisma stats, with some members expressing amusement over their character's poor charisma scores despite playing roles that require it. They also share anecdotes about past characters with mismatched skills and stats, highlighting the fun and unpredictability of such setups. As they arrive at the townmaster's hall, they find Sildar and Harbin, the townmaster, discussing. Sildar asks if they've reconsidered rescuing Gundren from Cragmaw Castle, prompting a negotiation for better compensation.<br><br>The group discusses the dangers and insufficient rewards of storming Cragmaw Castle. Sildar turns to Harbin to see if additional payment can be arranged. Harbin agrees to add another 100 gold pieces for rescuing Gundren, bringing the total to 200 gold pieces. However, the group expresses interest in dealing with the Red Brand Ruffians instead, as suggested by the townsfolk. Harbin downplays the threat posed by the ruffians but offers 50 gold pieces to clear them out, bringing the total potential reward to 300 gold pieces for both tasks.<br><br>The group discusses using their skills to persuade Harbin for a better deal. [Speaker 2] casts "Detect Good and Evil" to sense any hidden motives, confirming the presence of an evil influence. The group decides to use persuasion and intimidation to negotiate a higher reward. [Speaker 1] rolls a successful persuasion check, while another member rolls an insight check, revealing Harbin's genuine belief that the ruffians aren't a significant threat but also his power-hungry nature.<br><br>After successful persuasion, Harbin agrees to increase the reward. The group decides to accept the tasks of rescuing Gundren and dealing with the Red Brand Ruffians for a total of 300 gold pieces. They clarify the terms, ensuring fair distribution among themselves. The negotiation concludes with the group planning their next steps. They reminisce about past battles and strategize for future encounters, underscoring their camaraderie and readiness for the challenges ahead.<br><br>The group jokes about their character abilities and past experiences, focusing on their strengths and weaknesses. They discuss the benefits of their various skills and the potential for future growth, particularly for the dragonborn character who hopes to gain immunity to fire and electricity. The conversation reflects the group's dynamic and the humorous interplay between their characters' traits and their real-world interactions, setting the stage for their upcoming adventures.<br><br>The group agrees to take on the mission to deal with the Red Brand Ruffians, who are reportedly hanging out at the Sleeping Giant tap house on the east end of town. Harbin, the townmaster, provides directions and describes the ruffians as non-violent but intimidating towards the townspeople. One of the members, [Speaker 2], suggests using the wolf, Ghost, for reconnaissance to determine the number of ruffians present. While the group discusses the plan, another member heads to a local shop seeking wrist blades but finds the shopkeeper unhelpful. The group then gathers outside the townmaster's hall, preparing to move towards the tap house.<br><br>Ghost, the wolf, returns from his reconnaissance, reporting that there are as many ruffians as there are members in the group. [Speaker 2] casts "Speak with Animals" to communicate with Ghost, confirming the wolf's findings. During this, another wolf, Stormageddon, alerts the group to a follower who turns out to be one of their own members. They decide to move forward with caution, maintaining a strategic approach to the upcoming confrontation.<br><br>The group debates their next steps and strategy for dealing with the ruffians. [Speaker 2] questions the purpose and nature of their mission, emphasizing the need for a clear plan. There is a brief discussion about leadership and roles within the group, with some members reluctant to follow a single leader. They agree on a collaborative approach, ensuring everyone understands their part in the mission.<br><br>A persuasion check is performed to determine the group's willingness to follow a proposed plan. Despite initial resistance, the group agrees to move towards the tap house and confront the ruffians. The dynamic remains fluid, with no single leader emerging, but a consensus-driven approach taking shape. The group emphasizes the importance of working together and leveraging each member's strengths to achieve their goals.<br><br>The group finalizes their plan and prepares to confront the ruffians at the Sleeping Giant tap house. Tensions are high, with some members expressing distrust towards the townmaster and a desire for retribution. The session concludes with the group united in their mission, ready to face the challenges ahead while maintaining a cautious and strategic approach.<br><br>[Speaker 2] expresses frustration about the townmaster, Harbin, who seems indifferent to the terror caused by the Red Brand Ruffians. Despite a high insight check revealing no connection between Harbin and the ruffians, the group's annoyance with his lack of concern fuels their resolve. The group debates the forceful tone of advice given earlier, with some members feeling it was more of an ultimatum. This discussion highlights the tension and varying perspectives within the group, but they agree to proceed with caution and strategic planning.<br><br>The group finalizes their plan for confronting the ruffians at the Sleeping Giant tap house. [Speaker 1] and another member, along with the wolves, take the lead in approaching the building, while the others provide support from a distance. There is a humorous exchange about roles and abilities, emphasizing teamwork. As they approach, they see several figures seated on the porch of the tap house. The leader of the ruffians taunts them, leading to an intense standoff.<br><br>The ruffians, led by a particularly provocative member, mock the group and their wolves. [Speaker 1] casts a spell, Hex, on the ruffian leader, escalating the situation. Peer pressure among the ruffians leads them to come down from the porch, preparing for a fight. The group rolls for initiative, with high rolls indicating their readiness for the upcoming battle. They coordinate their efforts, ensuring everyone knows their role in the confrontation.<br><br>The group discusses their combat strategy, focusing on leveraging their strengths and the wolves' abilities. [Speaker 2], who is flying overhead, prepares to coordinate attacks from above. There is a detailed discussion about movement mechanics, especially concerning vertical movement during flight. The group's preparedness and strategic planning reflect their readiness for a challenging battle ahead.<br><br>The scene is set for an intense confrontation as the ruffians descend from the porch and the group prepares for battle. With everyone in position and roles clearly defined, the stage is set for a dramatic and strategic engagement. The group's unity and readiness underscore their determination to address the threat posed by the Red Brand Ruffians and protect the townspeople of Phandalin.<br><br>The group prepares for an aerial assault as [Speaker 2] instructs Stormageddon, the wolf, to drop down on the lead ruffian who was previously hexed. With dexterity and precision, Stormageddon lands directly on the ruffian, knocking him prone. The dramatic entrance of the wolf causes chaos among the ruffians, setting the stage for an intense battle. [Speaker 2] considers using polymorph spells for future engagements, hinting at turning into massive creatures like Tyrannosaurus Rexes.<br><br>As the battle unfolds, Stormageddon attempts to bite the prone ruffian but misses. The group continues to strategize and reposition themselves, with the wolves taking aggressive stances. The tension builds as they prepare for a coordinated attack. Despite some humor about dice rolls and equipment, the group maintains focus on the unfolding confrontation.<br><br>The group discusses their positioning and tactics. [Speaker 1] ensures everyone is ready for the fight, with members taking strategic positions around the tap house. Some engage directly, while others provide support from a distance. The conversation highlights the group's dynamic and the importance of each member's role in the combat scenario.<br><br>Aurora, one of the group members, takes initiative by readying her crossbow and targeting a ruffian towards the back of the group. Her swift action reflects the trust and coordination within the group, as they prepare to engage the ruffians in full combat. The group's mercenary background and loyalty to each other are emphasized, setting the tone for the upcoming battle.<br><br>The stage is set for a full-scale battle with the Red Brand Ruffians. The group's strategic positioning, combined with their diverse skills and abilities, suggests a challenging and dynamic encounter. As Aurora takes the first shot, the rest of the group braces for a fierce confrontation, ready to protect the town of Phandalin and prove their mettle as adventurers.<br><br>The group continues to strategize as they engage the ruffians at the Sleeping Giant tap house. Aurora shoots a crossbow bolt, targeting one of the ruffians standing behind the front line. Her arrow strikes, piercing the ruffian's leather armor and causing significant pain. The ruffians, unarmed and unprepared for a serious fight, begin to realize the gravity of their situation.<br><br>Rocklogger, one of the group’s frontline fighters, steps forward and swings his great axe at a ruffian, but the attack misses. The intimidating display of the large weapon and the group's aggressive stance cause unease among the ruffians. Despite the miss, the group's confidence remains high as they prepare for continued combat. The ruffians, now more aware of the threat, exchange taunts and reveal their allegiance to someone named Glass Staff, hinting at a larger organization behind their actions.<br><br>The group exchanges quick, tense words with the ruffians, learning that Glass Staff is their leader and they feel untouchable due to his protection. The group's resolve to challenge this authority grows, and they begin to coordinate their next moves more effectively. The conversation highlights the group’s mix of intimidation and curiosity about the true extent of the threat they face.<br><br>Ignatius, positioned further back from the immediate fray, decides to cast Chromatic Orb, a powerful spell aimed at the ruffians. The spell's potential damage signifies a serious escalation in the battle, demonstrating the group's willingness to use all their abilities to subdue their enemies. The decision to use such a potent spell reflects the group's strategic thinking and readiness to end the fight swiftly and decisively.<br><br>The scene remains intense as the group prepares for the next round of attacks. With their initial strategies in play and a combination of physical and magical assaults, the group demonstrates their commitment to protecting Phandalin and dismantling the ruffian threat. The engagement with the ruffians, now aware of the group's capabilities, sets the stage for a potentially explosive continuation of the conflict. The group’s unified front and tactical diversity highlight their readiness to face whatever challenges come next in their quest to secure the town.<br><br>Ignatius attempts to cast Chromatic Orb but realizes he lacks the necessary diamond, causing the spell to fizzle. He quickly shifts tactics, casting Chaos Bolt instead. The chaotic energy strikes one ruffian, causing severe damage and jumping to another, demonstrating the spell’s unpredictability and power. Ignatius's successful casting showcases his magical prowess, obliterating two ruffians with a combination of thunder and lightning damage. The sheer force of the attack leaves the group in awe and slightly apprehensive about the extent of their abilities.<br><br>The group discusses the aftermath of Ignatius's spell, noting the impressive yet gruesome results. They prepare for their next moves, with Ash readying his wolves and the rest of the group positioning themselves for further combat. The conversation reflects their mix of strategy and reaction to the sudden, intense battle. Despite the chaotic environment, they maintain a focus on their objective and consider their next steps carefully.<br><br>Ash and his wolves continue their assault on the ruffians. Ash’s first attack, though at a disadvantage due to the prone enemy, lands successfully, dealing significant damage. His second attack finishes off the ruffian. Meanwhile, Bulwark and Ghost, Ash’s wolves, target another ruffian, swiftly taking him down. The efficient and brutal attacks by Ash and his wolves demonstrate their combat effectiveness and coordination, further demoralizing the remaining ruffians.<br><br>Seeing the devastating attacks and the fall of their comrades, the remaining ruffians are visibly shaken. Ash issues an ultimatum, demanding their surrender to avoid further bloodshed. His intimidation check, bolstered by the recent display of power, succeeds, leading the ruffians to lay down their arms and plead for their lives. This moment of submission underscores the group's dominance in the encounter and their ability to control the battlefield through fear and force.<br><br>The group ceases their attacks as the ruffians surrender, taking stock of the situation and ensuring that the threat is neutralized. They discuss their next moves, considering the information gained about Glass Staff and the broader implications for their mission. The group's cohesion and tactical acumen are evident as they manage the aftermath of the battle, preparing for potential future confrontations with renewed confidence and a clearer understanding of their enemies.<br><br>As the group surveys the aftermath of the skirmish, Ace, who had been hanging back, finally moves closer, intrigued by the commotion. He notices a sign that says "Sleeping Giant" and recalls its significance to his character’s backstory. He performs a history check, realizing that this rundown tavern was once significant to his group before it was overrun by the Red Brands. He decides to peek inside, finding no patrons or barmaids, just a mess left by the ruffians. Meanwhile, the group interrogates the remaining Red Brands, learning that their hideout is in Tresendor Manor, located at the east end of the street, and that their leader, Glass Staff, resides there.<br><br>The group continues to extract information from the surrendered Red Brands. They learn that there are about ten Red Brands in the manor along with Glass Staff, and that a strange frog-like monster guards the lower part of the building. This information is crucial as they plan their next steps. The group debates their approach, considering the need to root out the entire threat to prevent the ruffians from regrouping and causing more trouble. Their resolve is strengthened by the knowledge that they need to confront Glass Staff to bring peace to the town.<br><br>The group’s banter and interactions provide a glimpse into their dynamics. They joke about riding each other into battle and discuss their character traits and strategies. Despite the humor, they maintain a focus on the mission ahead. The camaraderie is evident as they plan to tackle the challenges together, leveraging each member’s unique abilities. This section highlights the blend of strategy, character development, and humor that defines their adventure.<br><br>The group decides to investigate the mysterious manor on the hill, Tresendor Manor, known to be the Red Brands' main hideout. They approach cautiously, noting the lack of visible guards. Before proceeding to the manor, they return to the townmaster's hall to question Harbin and Sildar about the property. They learn that the Tresendor family has not been seen in years, and the house is essentially abandoned. With this information, they decide to confront the Red Brands directly. Ash, living up to his name, sets the house on fire, ensuring that any remaining ruffians inside are dealt with. This act symbolizes their commitment to eradicating the threat once and for all.<br><br>As the house burns, the group discusses the potential consequences and tactical advantages of their actions. They realize the fire might force the remaining Red Brands out of hiding, giving them a strategic upper hand. The discussion is briefly interrupted by light-hearted banter about the tactical use of spells and the benefits of taking down the structure. Their focus, however, remains on the mission at hand. The fire eventually causes the building to collapse, ensuring that any stragglers inside are dealt with.<br><br>Four Red Brand ruffians escape from the burning building, attempting to flee. The group, having anticipated this move, is strategically positioned around the house to intercept any escaping enemies. The scene is set for another confrontation as the adventurers prepare to engage the fleeing ruffians. The group’s tactical planning pays off as they catch the ruffians by surprise, ready to eliminate the remaining threats and further dismantle the Red Brands’ operation.<br><br>The adventurers, having set the house ablaze, prepare for any Red Brand ruffians attempting to escape. Positioned strategically around the house, they await their prey.
